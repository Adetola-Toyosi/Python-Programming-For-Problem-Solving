# Python Programming for Problem solving

- Learnt Python for problem solving

- Conducted an EDA on a sales dataset with 7,000 records and 21 features using SQL and Python. The aim was to analyse and create a UI that allows end-users retrieve data. The program design comprised of 5 modules and the main module was responsible for coordinating the interactions between all other modules. Custom functions were created, error handlers were utilized, context managers were used, etc. The python code was programmed in consistency with collaborative coding best practices including PEP8 coding style and Git for version control.
